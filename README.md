# XITIKIT Cloud Management Tools

The goal of this project is to be able to deploy and 
manage spring boot applications regardless of how and
where they are deployed.

For example, if I have 2 applications, built as war files.
and deployed to the same isntance of Tomcat, then all 
Spring Boot project features should be available (monitoring,
discovery, clustering, circuit breaker patterns, load balancing, 
configuration etc ...).
